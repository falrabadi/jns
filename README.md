# Welcome to JnS Supermarket

This is a project I made for my fathers business. It is a website that will show customers the products that we have in stock, and perhaps later, customers will be able to order snacks and other goods to be shipped.

## How to build

1. Clone this Repository

2. Run:
```
npm install
```
to install all the relevant dependencies

3. Navigate to the "jns" directory and run:
```
npm start
```
